        <h3>Welcome to osu!katakuna</h3>
        <span>osu!katakuna is the first osu! private server launched in Romania that has been written from scratch. It offers Multiplayer, PP(still in the works), a very friendly community and a development team that makes osu!katakuna stable and fun to play.</span><br>
        <br>
        <span>osu!katakuna is the result of the hard work of <a href="https://github.com/talnacialex">talnacialex</a>, that wanted to create his first private server for a game.</span><br>
        <br>
        <span>The best part about our server is the fact that we are <a href="https://github.com/osu-katakuna">open-source</a>! Yeah, you heard us right, OPEN-SOURCE! So that everyone could propose or add new features to our server.</span><br>
        <span>We also have a discord server, so if you want to speak to us, then feel free to join <a href="https://discord.gg/QDP4muY">here</a>!</span><br>
        <br><h3>Join our server! You won't regret it! ðŸ˜€</h3><br>
